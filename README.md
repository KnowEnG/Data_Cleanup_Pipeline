# KnowEnG's Data Cleanup Pipeline
 This is the Knowledge Engine for Genomics (KnowEnG), an NIH BD2K Center of Excellence, Data Cleanup Pipeline.
This pipeline **cleanup** the data of a given spreadsheet for subsequent processing by KnowEnG Analytics Platform.

## How to run this pipeline with Your data
* * * 

__***Follow steps 1-4 above then do the following:***__

### * Create your run directory

 ```
 mkdir run_directory
 ```

### * Change directory to the run_directory

 ```
 cd run_directory
 ```

### * Create your results directory

 ```
 mkdir results_directory
 ```
 
### * Create run_paramters file  (YAML Format)
 ``` 
Look for examples of run_parameters in ./Data_Cleanup_Pipeline/data/run_files/TEMPLATE_data_cleanup.yml
 ```
### * Modify run_paramters file  (YAML Format)
```
set the spreadsheet, and drug_response (phenotype data) file names to point to your data
```

### * Run the Data Cleanup Pipeline:

  * Update PYTHONPATH enviroment variable
   ``` 
   export PYTHONPATH='../src':$PYTHONPATH    
   ```
   
  * Run (these relative paths assume you are in the test directory with setup as described above)
   ```
  python3 ../src/data_cleanup.py -run_directory ./run_dir -run_file TEMPLATE_data_cleanup.yml
   ```
